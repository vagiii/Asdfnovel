# Asdfnovel (starter)

Minimal Android app skeleton for a Scrivener-like writing app.

What this includes:
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose UI
- Room database with Project entity
- Hilt DI
- Basic Project list screen and ViewModel

How to run:
1. Open this folder in Android Studio (Electric Eel / Flamingo or newer).
2. Ensure JDK 17 is used (or configure Gradle to use appropriate toolchain).
3. Build and run on an emulator API 26+ or physical device.

Next steps you might want me to implement:
- Document/Scene entity and editor screen (Markdown editor)
- Binder (hierarchical outline) UI with drag & drop
- Corkboard view with card drag & drop and synopsis editing
- Export / import (ZIP / markdown)
- Cloud sync (WebDAV/Google Drive)
- Unit & instrumentation tests

If you'd like, I can push these files to your GitHub repo (vagiii/Asdfnovel). Reply with the branch name (e.g. `feature/starter`) and confirm you want me to create the files there.
